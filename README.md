-   Favorite Movies Functionality:

    Implemented the ability for users to add and remove movies from their favorites list using local storage.
    This ensures that favorite movies persist across sessions.

-   Pagination Optimization:

    Improved the rendering process by implementing pagination.
    This optimizes the user experience by displaying a limited number of movies per page, reducing the load time and enhancing performance.
